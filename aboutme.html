    A bit about me.

    <div class="div">
        I am an entrepreneur, and upon withdrawing from school in 2010, I started a small transportation company. After becoming established, I went back to school and finished my political science degree in 2013. I have 13 years of experience in a leadership role that encompasses all aspects of the company and firmly believe that appreciation for, and contributing to, personal development in one?s team leads to a happier, healthier, and more effective organization.
